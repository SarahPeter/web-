<h3> Introduction </h3>

<p> The movie Perfect Blue was released August 20, 1999 by Satoshi Kon. 
It is critically acclaimed on Rotton Tomatoes and is deemed one of the best movies of all time (at least in the genre of anime). 
The movie is based on the novel Perfect Blue: Complete Metamorphosis and it was the Kon's debut movie. The film follows the journey of Mimi Kirigoe, 
a former pop star in a girl group called CHAM, who makes the ultimate decision to switching her career to acting. However, in the process she finds herself becoming the victim of a stalker who 
is a die hard fan of Mimi's pop past. As this whole dillema is going on, Mimi finds herself struggling in her new acting career because although she lands herself 
a (small) role in a new show, a series of murders occur at the same time. Mimi loses her grasp of reality and grays the lines between the plot of the show she's acting in and her own life. 
She has become haunted by a ghost, a version of her past cheery pop idol self and these murders are all correlated to men who have tried to modify Mimi's public image.

<h3> Character Breakdown </h3>

who is a people pleaser to not only her close friends and family but to her devoted fans. In the attempt of trying to erase her former "good girl" image through her serious acting career, she finds herself to

Rumi Hidaka: She is the deuteragonist of the movie and is Mimi's manager who helps her with her assimilation of the acting industry. Rumi found herself in Mimi because 
she also was once a pop idol before changing careers. So, as Rumi witnesses Mimi and the absolute atrocities she has to go through such as sexual assault, Rumi slowly 
becomes delusioned and thinks she is the "real" Mimi and must restore her reputation. She was the one behind the murders and her motives were all in the name of revenge 
for the sake of Mimi's image. Rumi was doing this behind the scenes as she encouraged the stalker to murder Mimi which led to Mimi's slow descent of madness. Finally, 
this is all revealed to Mimi thus Rumi and her finally face each other in the climax of the movie as they Rumi chases Mimi around the city looking to kill her and become the "real" Mimi. 
Luckily, Mimi prevails and Rumi is sent to a mental facility where she most likely struggles with Dissociative Identity Disorder which created a split in Rumi's mind as there her reality and her alter of "real" Mimi.

Mamoru Uchida (aka Me-Mania) : He is the secondary antagonist and is the stalker who is later killed by Rumi. Mamoru has an obsession with Mimi to the point of worship, 
as his room is a shrine plastered with a myriad of photos of her. He is seen as a freak or a weirdo because of his grotesque face. Over the course of the movie, his obession with her grows and grows 
by constantly following her with a tape recorder, creating a website of her so other fans can view, and buying magazines of her. Due to Rumi's conditioning, he is convinced that
the actual Mimi is a mere imposter of the "real" Mimi thus he proceeds to find her and try to assaulti her until Mimi knocks him unconscious. Rumi finishes the job later and brutally murders him.

<h3> Overall Themes & Analysis </h3> 

<body> 

<p> Ultimately, the title summarizes the overall tone of the movie - it represents the perfection of madness and melancholy. It embodies the different manifestations of love from the pursuit of the love,
the possesion of love, the loss of love and lastly the absence of love. Additionally, it can be seen as a testament to idol culture and how women are exploited through it the most, especially through men. Throughout, the course of the movie
an overarching problem was the various views of how men viewed Mimi, either as a pure pop idol, a rooky actress, etc but either way they all valued her sexual appeal the most. While the ending is on a high note, 
you cannot help but feel deeply disturbed and stricken by how jarring the entire movie is. It is a journey of finding self-identity and Mimi's feminity plays the most crucial role in it all. Here's a link to much more detailed and amazing analysis of the movie
